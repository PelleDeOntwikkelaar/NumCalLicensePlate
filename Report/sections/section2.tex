\section{Problem Breakdown}
In this section the general problem is brought down to simpilar and smaller sub problems.
The goals of this section is not making more objectives but making a clear and good dividence in the project.
Important in breaking down a problem is th clear definition off the sub problems.
It has to be very clear what every part consists off and most important when a sub problem is solved.
Out off this last defintion follows that it has to be possible to test every different sub problem in a convenient way.
To summarize: a project consists off different sub problems which all have the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Title
    \item Clear and simple objective.
    \item Orientation whitin the whole project.
    \item Test conditions.
\end{itemize}
Multiple sub problems can be combined into a project phase.
