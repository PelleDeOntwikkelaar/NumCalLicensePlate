\section{Problem Breakdown}
In this section the general problem is brought down to simpilar and smaller sub problems.
The goals of this section is not making more objectives but making a clear and good dividence in the project.
Important in breaking down a problem is th clear definition off the sub problems.
It has to be very clear what every part consists off and most important when a sub problem is solved.
Out off this last defintion follows that it has to be possible to test every different sub problem in a convenient way.
To summarize: a project consists off different sub problems which all have the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Title
    \item Clear and simple objective.
    \item Orientation whitin the whole project.
    \item Test conditions.
\end{itemize}
Multiple sub problems can be combined into a project phase.
When talking about project phases, the following phases can be defined, there is a large resemblance with the goals defind in the previous section.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Image manipulation: Manipulate the input image to a form where it is easy to start the proces of finding the license plate.
    \item The search: The search off the interire (manipulated) image to the license plate.
    \item Evaluation: Confirmation or denial. 
\end{itemize}
These project phases each consist of multiple sub problems, these are defined in the following subsections.
\subsection{Image manipulation}
As earlier described consists this project phase of preparing the image for the search off a license plate.
The preparation of this image consists of multiple steps.
Each of these steps can be considerd a sub problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{sub:uniform} \textbf{Uniform:} Transform the image to a uniform dimension. In this way all images from this point on have accactly the same characteristics.  
    \item \label{sub:greyscale} \textbf{Greyscale:} Transform the image to a greyscale version off itself.
    \item \label{sub:noise} \textbf{Noise:} Removal of possible noise in the picture.
    \item \label{sub:detectAllEdges}\textbf{Edges: }Detecting off all the possible edges in an image.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{The Search}
\subsection{Evaluation}
